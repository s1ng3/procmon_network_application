// Description: This file contains the main function that runs the server and client threads.

// The server thread listens for incoming connections and processes the commands sent by the client.
// The client thread sends commands to the server and receives the response.

// The main function displays a menu of available commands and allows the user to choose a command to execute.
// The user can exit the program by entering 0.

// The server and client threads are implemented using Winsock API for socket programming.

// Use DisplayHelp function to display the available commands and their descriptions.
